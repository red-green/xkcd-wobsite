## a better xkcd website

I wanted a better way to display XKCD, and this project was born. It has commenting on each comic, alt text displayed below the comic, links to the ExplainXKCD and official site for each one, and some useful mini-webapps.

To build the database of comics, simply run `data/sqldownload.py`. The rest of the databases should be taken care of when you run `main.py`.
